# Tamkang University Mock Homepage (Week 14)

This directory contains a mock implementation of the Tamkang University (TKU) homepage, demonstrated as part of Week 14 coursework.

## Overview

The project showcases a responsive web design that mimics the structure and styling of a university portal. It includes a top navigation bar, a main header with a logo, a hero carousel section, and informational content blocks.

## Features

- **Top Bar**: A utility bar with links for navigation, calendar, language selection, and user roles (Student, Faculty, etc.).
- **Main Header**: Contains the university logo and a simplified navigation menu with dropdown indicators.
- **Hero Carousel**: An interactive image slider that cycles through highlights (e.g., Sustainability Awards) automatically every 5 seconds. It also supports manual navigation via previous/next buttons.
- **Content Sections**:
  - **Admissions News**: A list of recent announcements.
  - **Feature Highlight**: A dedicated section for special chairs or lectures.
- **Responsive Footer**: Displays contact information and social media links.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: semantic structure (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- **CSS3 (Vanilla)**: Custom styling including:
  - CSS Variables for color consistency.
  - Flexbox and Grid for layout.
  - Responsive media queries for mobile adaptation.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**:
  - Logic for the auto-playing carousel slider.
  - DOM manipulation for active slide toggling.
